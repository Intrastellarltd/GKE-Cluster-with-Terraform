## Introduction

Welcome to the Terraform-GCP-K8s-Infra repository! üöÄ In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating a robust and scalable Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. By following best practices, you'll ensure a secure, maintainable, and collaborative infrastructure deployment.

## Problem Statement

Managing infrastructure manually can be error-prone, challenging to collaborate on, and lacks the scalability needed for modern cloud environments. Deploying a Kubernetes cluster requires a systematic approach, and using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the solution. This tutorial addresses the challenges of:

- **Local State Management:** Avoiding the pitfalls of managing Terraform state locally on individual machines.

- **Collaboration:** Enabling effective collaboration among team members by utilizing remote storage for Terraform state.

- **Best Practices:** Demonstrating the best practices for setting up GCP infrastructure, from VPC creation to GKE clusters, while ensuring security and scalability.

## Solution

### Configure Terraform GCS Backend

To ensure seamless collaboration, we'll configure Terraform to use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a backend for storing state. This approach provides a centralized location for managing Terraform state, making it easier to collaborate and avoid accidental infrastructure destruction.

### Setup Terraform GCP Provider

Declare the Terraform provider for GCP, which acts as the library for creating and managing infrastructure in the Google Cloud Platform environment.

### Create VPC in GCP using Terraform

Walk through the process of creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform, ensuring that the infrastructure is ready for the subsequent deployment of a GKE cluster.

### Create Subnet, Cloud Router, Cloud NAT, and Firewall

Step-by-step guide on creating a private subnet for Kubernetes nodes, setting up a Cloud Router for route advertisement, implementing Cloud NAT for internet access, and creating a firewall to control SSH access.

### Create GKE Cluster and Node Pools

Configure the GKE cluster's control plane and create multiple node pools using Terraform, adhering to best practices for security and scalability.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional GKE cluster deployed on GCP, orchestrated with Terraform, following industry best practices. Let's embark on this journey together towards efficient, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure! üåêüõ†Ô∏è
